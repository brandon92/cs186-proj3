In general, we did this project in the order in which the components were
introduced in the spec. This led to a few confusions, such as not realizing all
the methods of not-yet-implemented methods. In particular, pid.getTableId() was
a pain point. Another hurdle was using unfamiliar Java classes, such as
RandomAccessFile. A quick read through of it's spec wasn't comprehensive enough,
and instead of using scan then read, we tried to pass in the offset as an
argument to read. The offset actually referred to the target byte[], not the
one being read from, as we had expected. Overall though, it went smoothly. The
cycle was to implement the next excercise, then debug it until it passed the
test. The hardest part was wrapping our heads around the whole simpledb
architecture, from the db to the catalog of tables, to the heapfiles of
heappages. Overall though, the layout is clear and well documented.
